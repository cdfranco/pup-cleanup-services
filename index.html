            and even send a picture of the closed gate when they leave. The
            owners are some of the nicest people, and are VERY responsive. I
            highly recommend them and plan to do business with them for a long

                No! As part of PUP Clean UP's All-Inclusive Service, we haul
                away all scooped waste and dispose of it properly so you can
                keep your trash can clean & odor-free.

                Absolutely! We love to work with your furry friends around.
                However, the safety of our team is priority — so we ask that any
                dogs with aggressive tendencies be left inside.

                When we're done picking up your yard we will ensure that your

                closed gate and send it to you for your peace of mind.

                Our all-inclusive service that EVERY client receives (waste
                cleanup, waste haul-away, & disinfectant treatment) starts at
                $23 per week & varies dependent upon how many dogs you have &
                the frequency of cleanups that you prefer.

                We will always take requests & do what we can to accomodate.
                However, we don't offer scheduling for specific days or arrival
                windows. We design our client routes ahead of time to optimize
                efficiency & keep our costs low, which in turn keeps prices low.
                We will text you the day before to let you know we will be
                coming the next day.
